Database Management Systems Expert
Date: July 5, 2023

I think I'll start this first blog by giving the classic
elevator pitch. Hi, my name is Noah Lewis. I am currently
a senior at Louisiana State University studying Computer
Science. I am also getting a minor in mathematics. I worked
for about 6 months as a back-end C# ASP.NET developer for 
Rural Sourcing. After that I got another job at Vigilus
as another back-end engineer. It is a startup so I work
on many different projects with a diverse group of tools 
including Firebase, AWS, Postgres, Express, GCF, and many 
many others. I also currently work part time as a cloud 
computing engineer for LSU. The project I'm involved with
aims to collect a data from using IOT sensors, send 
this data to a database, and then perform analysis and provide 
user feedback. So that's my elevator pitch. While I have
experience using DBMS's in my work I feel like the internals
are a black box and that is what I'm here to uncover.

So, today I started taking the first steps towards learning 
how to create database management systems. To begin,
I started with looking around this website 
https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dbbook/openAccess/Minibase/minibase.html.
I read chapter 1 of the correlating book and also read about all the
components of the example DBMS named Minibase. Chapter 1 
just gave an overview of DBMS's explaining their purpose 
and a simple view of how they work internally. I specifically
chose this book because of the book assigns to reader to 
implement certain components of Minibase.

Welp, that's it for today, thx for reading.
